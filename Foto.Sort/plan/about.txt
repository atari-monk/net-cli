This is a draft, to test snipets of code that can be used in MVP (minimum viable product).
Every app should have proof of concept phase that helps to determine how idea really works.
This phase should be fast testing of snipets of code without any architecture or refactoring,
to minimize time needed to answar if idea has any potential.
Even if app has next versions it's probably usefull to keep such drafts.
